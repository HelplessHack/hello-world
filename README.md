Hi Humans!

I am a computer science graduate student, specializing in Cyber Security and Information Assurance.
Despite being a compute science graduate student, I really have almost no idea what I am doing.
I hope that through hardwork and determination, I can develop the necessary skills to go from innitiate to master.

I am in your care,
